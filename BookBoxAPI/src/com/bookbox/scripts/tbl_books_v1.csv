1,"A Question of Inheritance","Elizabeth Edmondson ","Thomas & Mercer","December 1953

Hugo Hawksworth is on the tail of rogue Cold War agents at a top-secret government facility, while back home at Selchester Castle they are awaiting the arrival of the new Earl—an American, the long-lost son of the murdered Lord Selchester.

The town of Selchester, rich in scandal and gossip, is unsure what to make of the Earl or his teenage daughters, but they know that his sharp-tongued half-sister, Lady Sonia, furious at being deprived of her inheritance, will not be a merry guest over Christmas.

The new Lord Selchester can cope with the strangeness of English country life, but he had not expected stolen paintings—or a body in the hothouse.

What’s the link between Hugo’s investigations and the suspicious goings-on in the town and at the Castle? And will he and his allies get to the heart of the mystery before the murderer gets to them?

As Walker Gibson looks at her, then at the damage to his precious truck (that she may or may not have accidentally inflicted), she knows she’s in trouble. It’s not the busted headlight and dented grill that’s sunk her though. It’s the downright sinful man in front of her that’s the problem.

A legendary author and indisputably the greatest storyteller in his genre of all time, L’Amour captivated millions of readers and has sold well over three hundred million copies of his works, which includes nearly ninety novels and countless short stories.

Mistakes Can Kill You highlights an essential selection featuring nine of L’Amour’s earlier short stories, sometimes written under the pen name Jim Mayo, that exemplify the rugged morality of the best Western writing. In “Black Rock Coffin-Makers,” two men ready to kill over ownership of a ranch get more than they bargain for when a stranger is caught in the crossfire. And in “Four- Card Draw,” Allen Ring wins a ranch in a poker game, only to find out an unsolved murder was committed there years ago and law enforcement thinks Ring knows more about it than he’s letting on.

L’Amour made his characters come alive on the page, and his ability to capture the spirit and authenticity of the Wild West is unrivaled. Mistakes Can Kill You transports you to a world you’ll never want to leave, and proves that Louis L’Amour will always be the king of spinning a classic Western yarn.

That is why the struggle between various species does not arise from feeling of mutual antipathy but rather from hunger and love. In both cases, nature looks on calmly and is even pleased with what happens. The struggle for daily livelihood leaves behind in the ruck everything that is weak or disased or wavering, while the flight of the male to process the female gives to the strongest, the right or at least the possibility, to propagate. And this struggle is a means of furthering the health and powers of resistance in the species. Thus it is one of the causes underlying the process of development towards a higher quality of being.",2,0,/I421.jpg,/Mein_Kampf.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:33:49.852893",0

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.

He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition to his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing, and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called Theres Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely Youre Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think?

Whatever your circumstances, you can create the life you desire by following simple, counterintuitive steps; not the steps society wants you to follow. Unfortunately, you cannot even trust yourself when it comes to creating the life that you desire, because you’re programmed by your past, an accumulation of hundreds of thousands of years, a mind still adapted for a hunter-gatherer time period. What does this mean? It means every day you’re battling your emotions, logic versus emotion. Logically, you want to do one thing, but emotionally, you are drawn to something else. First, if this sounds familiar, then great, because it means you are human. But, if you’re going to win the game of life, you cannot sit around and wait for things to happen, because you’ll be living a life of supreme comfort and sameness; ultimately, a great sin. You are destined for great things, capable of forging dreams and living your aspirations. Maybe you’ve forgotten about this truth: that you are capable, worthy, and ready. Maybe you’ve been beaten into the ground by life, a teacher who doesn’t care if you’re rich or poor, weak or strong, ready or not, because life will continue forward regardless, waiting for no one. 

Fortunately, there’re things you can do to set yourself apart from the millions that will ultimately suffer and fail. One such thing, perhaps the most powerful of all, is by studying the great, people who have succeeded and who have gone beyond what is humanly thought possible. When it comes to studying someone great, there’s one name that stands tall, Stephen Hawking, a person who has persevered and flourished. Not only has he conquered great adversity, but he has inspired millions around the world with his brilliant mind. There is a reason why people compare him with the once living Albert Einstein, the genius. What follows are Stephen Hawking’s greatest life lessons, gems of wisdom that you can easily apply to your own life, which will help you live a more abundant, stronger life. If you’re in need of inspiration, a boost of confidence, or just a friendly reminder of the wonders in life, you’ve come to the right place.

Kanwar Created a Global Giant","Tim Bouquet","Rupa Publications","In 1974, one of India’s greatest post-Independence entrepreneurs Raunaq Singh acquired the licence to operate a tyre company in Kerala. However, there was no factory. It was a company registered in name only. Apollo Tyres. Thanks to Onkar Singh Kanwar, Raunaq’s eldest son, Apollo is today one of India’s most successful automotive companies with a turnover in excess of $2 billion and factories across India and in Europe.

This is the story, never told before, of how Onkar Singh Kanwar built Apollo from scratch and took it to the world stage. To do it, he had to combat strikes and union intimidation, the restrictions of the Licence Raj, politically motivated nationalisation, and near bankruptcy.

As if that was not enough, he also had to endure and survive a traumatic falling-out with the father he so admired. Never before has Onkar Kanwar spoken so openly or movingly about the father he still reveres and his regrets that life should have been so different from what he would have liked it to be.

The Man Behind the Wheel recounts these dramatic events in compelling detail as Onkar Kanwar follows his steadfast vision to build not just a company, but also an industrial institution. For the first time Onkar Kanwar’s closest friends and colleagues have spoken about the triumphs and the setbacks that have shaped both his and the company’s life and times. His wife and family share their personal insights of the man who is at the hub and heart of their world and how his values as a Sikh, father, brother and husband have moulded him as an entrepreneur.

The Man Behind the Wheel is the insightful and exciting story of a highly successful company and its creator as he takes us on a journey through his early days in the US of the 1960s, importing and exporting in the pre-boom Middle East, to building factories in Vadodara and Chennai, and further expansion to the Netherlands and Hungary with stop-offs in China and a highly charged courtroom battle in the United States.

97,"Thomas Edison: The Biography","University Press Biographies","University Press","Thomas Alva Edison has been referred to as the Wizard of Menlo Park, the Napoleon of Inventors, and America’s Uncrowned King, and he was voted number one in TIME Magazine’s list of people who made the millennium. It is not hyperbole to say that Thomas Edison truly changed the world. Simply imagine the realities of the life Edison was born into, compare it to the world he left behind, and consider how much this one man contributed to the rapid change that dragged the world into the modern age.

The list of inventions attributed to Edison is astoundingly long. Edison developed the world’s first incandescent electric lamp, or light bulb, he invented the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and introduced the very principles of electrical distribution. Edison created the first industrial research laboratory and awakened the world to what could be achieved by collaboration. With over 1000 US patents to his name, Edison invented hundreds of new and improved devices that radically changed the way people lived all over the world.

Born into humble beginnings, Edison’s life story looks at first glance like a rags to riches archetype, but dig a little deeper and you soon see that his trajectory was far from a straight line. Edison was an intelligent man and a hard worker but these qualities alone were not enough to take him from selling candy and fruit on train carriages in Port Huron to being one of the most famous and respected men in America.

Remembered now, Edison was one of the world’s winners, rich and famous and accomplished, but during his lifetime Edison failed time and time again. As a young man he was frequently fired, as an older man his ventures sometimes failed, he lost his fortune more than once, and at times his inventions simply did not work. But Edison never gave up, he bounced back from every disaster, and with good-natured stubbornness went on to bigger and better things.

Edison made a contribution to the world that is coveted by many but rivaled by few. Edison’s life begins with a small boy educated by his mother in Port Huron and ends with the death of the greatest inventor America has ever known, but Edison’s story will never end. A new chapter is added to Edison’s story every time a new wizard pushes the boundaries and invents something no one has ever seen before.",2,0,/I124.jpg,/Thomas_Edison.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:33:52.931335",0

But things get worse from there.

Watching Hitlers rise to power spurns his desire to avoid yet another war that will completely destroy his beloved country. Q makes the conscious decision to fight against what he knows is wrong, even if working against the Nazis could mean certain death for him— and anyone he loves.

Hilde Dremmer has vowed to never love again. But after encountering Q, she wants to give love a second chance. 

When Q discloses his resistance plan, it’s up to Hilde to choose between her protected life without him or the constant threat of torture if she supports him in his fight against injustice. 

She has witnessed enough of the Nazi governments violent acts to be appalled by the new political power, but will this be enough for an ordinary girl to do the extraordinary and stand beside the man she loves in a time of total desolation?

This World War II spy story is based on the true events of one couples struggle for happiness while battling a war against their own leaders.

Most investment strategies are just too complicated, too risky, or too subjective.

Typical investment strategies completely ignore human emotions, and making emotional investment decisions is the most common cause of losses for investors.

Risky trading strategies advertised with get-rich-quick hype may create big wins for a lucky few, but most people just end up with big losses and nothing to show for all their hard work and the emotional rollercoaster they endured.

Creating and maintaining real wealth through stock investing requires a long-term investment strategy that properly manages risk and prevents emotional decision-making so that you never suffer major losses.

The FALCON Method is completely different than typical stock investing strategies. The reason it beats the market again and again is because it uses an evidence-based stock selection process that anyone can follow. You don’t need to get lucky, take big risks, or fly by the seat of your pants in order to retire wealthy from stock investing.

Successful investing requires structured decision-making based on a proven process, and that’s exactly how The FALCON Method was created.

Its advantages are clear: web services are platform-independent (like Java itself), language-agnostic (a clear advantage over Java RMI), can easily be tunneled through firewalls (an obvious benefit to anyone who has dealt with modern enterprise networks), object-oriented (we all know about that) and tends to be loosely coupled (allowing more flexible application development). But these advantages have been obscured by a cloud of hype and a proliferation of jargon that are difficult to penetrate. What are SOAP, UDDI, WSDL and JAXM? To say nothing of JAXR, tModels, category bags, WSFL and other friends? And assuming that you understand what they are, how do you do anything with them? Do they live up to their promises? Are they really the future of network computing or a dead end?

Java Web Services gives the experienced Java developer a way into the Web Services world. It helps you to understand whats going on, what the technologies mean and how they relate and shows Java developers how to put them to use to solve real problems. You will learn whats real and what isnt, what the technologies are really supposed to do and how they do it. Java Web Services shows you how to use SOAP to perform remote method calls and message passing, how to use WSDL to describe the interface to a web service or understand the interface of someone elses service and how to use UDDI to advertise (publish) and look up services in each local or global registry. Java Web Services also discusses security issues, interoperability issues, integration with other Java enterprise technologies like EJB, the work being done on the JAXM and JAX-RPC packages and integration with Microsofts .Net services.

The web services picture is still taking shape, there are many platforms and APIs to consider and many conflicting claims from different marketing groups. And although web services are inherently language-independent, the fit between the fundamental principles on which Java and web services are based means that Java will almost certainly be the predominant language for web services development. If youre a Java developer and want to climb on the web services bandwagon or if you only want to kick the tires and find out what web services has to offer, you will find this book indispensable.",4,0,/I610.jpg,/OReilly_Java_Web_Services.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:37:20.641318",0

Despite its name, unit testing is really a coding technique, not a testing technique. Unit testing is done by programmers, for programmers. Its primarily for our benefit: we get improved confidence in our code, better ability to make deadlines, less time spent in the debugger, and less time beating on the code to make it work correctly. This book shows how to write tests, but more importantly, it goes where other books fear to tread and gives you concrete advice and examples of what to test--the common things that go wrong in all of our programs. Discover the tricky hiding places where bugs breed, and how to catch them using the freely available JUnit framework. Its easy to learn how to think of all the things in your code that are likely to break. Well show you how with helpful mnemonics, summarized in a handy tip sheet (also available from our www.pragmaticprogrammer.com website) to help you remember all this stuff. With this book you will: • Write better code, and take less time to write it • Discover the tricky places where bugs breed • Learn how to think of all the things that could go wrong • Test individual pieces of code without having to include the whole project • Test effectively with the whole team Well also cover how to use Mock Objects for testing, how to write high quality test code, and how to use unit testing to improve your design skills. Well show you frequent gotchas--along with the fixes--to save you time when problems come up. Well show you how with helpful mnemonics, summarized in a handy tip sheet (also available from our www.pragmaticprogrammer.com website). But the best part is that you dont need a sweeping mandate to change your whole team or your whole company.

In a healthy immune system, this communication is clear and specific; the body can tell the difference between a foreigner and itself. But in autoimmune disease, the immune response is flawed, and the communication system breaks down. The body’s immune system takes aim at its own tissues. Either the immune system can’t distinguish the body’s tissues from foreign cells and begins to attack itself, or it’s unable to regulate the intensity of the immune response. Regardless, the result is damage to the body’s tissues and the development of an autoimmune disease.

In this quick, easy to read guide, James Lee has trawled through all the research and clinical trials for curcumin to give you just the facts
What exactly is curcumin and what has it been shown to treat?
What are the different forms of curcumin (such as BMC-95, Meriva, Longvida and Theracumin) and are they effective?
Are there any side-effects or toxicity concerns?
Does it interact with my other medications?
What does the research and clinical trial data say?
Along with certain other supplements such as omega 3 fatty acids, n-acetylcysteine and alpha lipoic acid, curcumin is one of the few supplements which James Lee believes should be almost compulsory for many people. All three of these supplements together provides you with a a potent anti-aging, anti-depressive, liver detoxifying anti-inflammatory arsenal.",5,0,/I464.jpg,/Curcumin.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:37:22.973026",0
215,"Diabetes Unpacked: Just Science and Sense. No Sugar Coating","Tim Noakes","Columbus Publishing","Diabetes used to be rare and clear. One boy in the school had Type 1 and a friend of a friend’s granny had Type 2. We now see adults being diagnosed with Type 1 and children developing Type 2. There are over 400 million diabetics world-wide – four times as many as in 1980. The vast majority of these have Type 2 – sometimes judged as a ‘lifestyle’ disease.

The traditional view of diabetes is that is it a “chronic and progressive” condition and that nothing can be done about it. Serious complications include loss of eyesight, amputations and death. 

This book has gathered together some of the finest minds working in the field of diabetes and diet. The result is a collection of chapters by thought leaders, academics and doctors addressing the big issues. What is diabetes? What are the different types? What causes it? Who gets it? Why do we eat so much carbohydrate? Why do diabetics die of heart disease? Why do athletes commonly get Type 2 diabetes?

The writers in this book approach diabetes from many different angles, but they all share one common belief: Diabetes does not need to be “chronic and progressive.” Both Type 1 and Type 2 can be substantially alleviated and the latter can be ‘put into remission.’

Heres How an Overworked Computer Engineer Accidentally Discovered the Little-Known Secrets to Build Muscle and Lose Fat


I’d had enough of my unhealthy lifestyle… I didn’t exercise … I had a two hour commute to my hospital IT job in Chicago… I had a wife and 2 kids (4 & 7)


And most of the fitness advice I read was geared towards guys who had the time to workout 6 days a week. 



But after a LOT of research and trial and error, I finally figured out how to burn fat and build muscle while still maintaining my busy lifestyle. The result is The Science of Getting Ripped



This is my step-by-step manual I created for busy guys that want to burn fat, build muscle, get stronger, and increase their athleticism and power. I share the secrets and tips that regular guys can use to get in incredible shape. This is not a typical bodybuilding book because its geared towards regular guys with busy lives.

One of the biggest misconceptions about being funny is that you are either a natural-born comedian or you can’t tell a joke to save your life. The truth of the matter is that being funny is a talent, and like any other talent or skill, it can either be developed or neglected. Ask any stand-up comedian, and they’ll likely have a story to tell you how their first few performances were absolute nightmares. They didn’t know how to engage the audience, and they didn’t yet have their timing and delivery all worked out. Even people who feel called to be funny, or who are perhaps naturally funny, still have much to learn about the nature of humor before it seems easy to them. In this ebook you’ll learn the fundamental principles of good humor. You’ll also learn how to summon the proper energy and charisma to keep people entertained and laughing. If you’re ready to be the life of the party in a comfortable and easy way, then read on!

Using personal stories from the industry, entertaining and insightful techniques as well as exercises, a range of case studies and helpful examples this book will assist you in...

- finding inspiration for amazing comedy characters.
- adding layers and dimension to your characters as well as giving them longevity.
- setting up your characters to produce jokes with minimal effort.
- using various exercises to help you to get to know your characters at an intimate level.
- beating writers block and the need for redrafting by ensuring that you make the right choices before you put pen to paper.

Writing jokes is a serious business. Producers and commissioners looking for the next big thing are easily put off by characters that feel inconsistent or unremarkable. By putting in the effort in character construction early on you will put yourself miles ahead of the competition and get your script noticed. This book will give you the know how. Paul has over ten years experience in writing and is now sharing his secrets gained from his time as a commissioned sitcom writer. His methods are fun, engaging, often challenging and written with passion and expertise.

“What Paul did for my writing and comedy characters has been amazing. His industry experience has given me a step by step recipe for creating amazing comedic characters. After taking his course and using his development services I was able to take my ideas, which existed as notes on paper, and turn them into a script and then a filmed pilot sketch show. Absolutely no chance this could have been done without Paul’s one to one mentoring and advice.”

282,"Khushwant Singhs Joke Book 9","Khushwant Singh","Orient Publishing","I can do no better than reproduce the introduction I have written for my 9th Joke Book. It says all I want to say about my being an inveterate Joker. I was 94 when Joke Book 8 was published I was sure that it would be the last of the series. I was on a diet of pills and in poor health. But here I am 97 years old and here is Joke Book 9 (Orient Paperbacks). Laughter is evidently the elixir of life, the best tonic in the world to ensure a long and happy life.
Laughter is not only the best tonic but humorous writing and relating other peoples jokes is very lucrative, as both my publishers and I have found. Everyone of the earlier books in the series has gone into more than a dozen reprints. They are to be seen on pavement, railway station and airport bookstalls.
But not everyone enjoys jokes, especially when they are the target. This is especially true of politicians who have notoriously thin skins. We have had quite a few very good cartoonists - Shankar Pillai, R.K. Laxman, Vijayan, Rajinder Puri, Mario Miranda. Their cartoons have enlivened our newspapers and magazines and brought a smile on our faces. But many politicians and political parties take themselves very seriously and consider far too many topics as sacred cows not to be laughed about. They take umbrage at being the butt of jokes.
Laughter for them is no laughing matter. They serve who poke fun at them with legal notices - or worse.

283,"Mango Cheeks, Metal Teeth","ARUNA NAMBIAR","Westland ltd","Set in small-town Kerala of the 1980s, Mango Cheeks, Metal Teeth is part coming-of-age story, part social satire and part comedy of errors. Geetha, elevenish, is off for the annual family vacation in Kerala and is looking forward to all the fun with her cousins – visits to the beach and trips to the market to buy glass bangles and kites and shuttlecocks, evenings in the veranda listening to her grandfather’s ridiculous ghost stories which he swears are all true, marathon card games and ferocious boys-versus-girls battles with the bristles of brooms made from coconut fibre… 

But as the summer unfolds, Geetha finds herself spending more time instead at the back of the house with the free-spirited cook, the hypochondriac cleaner, the virile gardener, a cheeky helper girl… ...And Babu, son of Koovait Kannan, the bumbling plumber who made good. Babu’s family is immersed, meanwhile, in the wedding preparations for Babu’s sister, who is marrying the most eligible bachelor in the neighbourhood: Constable Venu, an expert thrasher of suspects and son of that wealthy black-marketer of supplies, Ration Raaman. But Babu’s mind is otherwise occupied… with thoughts of a face as rounded as a Malgova mango, of an oiled plait as thick as the ropes used to tie the fishing boats, of eyes that sparkle like the sea on a sunlit morn… 

As Geetha and Babu’s closely linked but widely divergent lives intersect, both are about to lose some of the blissful ignorance and innocence of childhood. Charmingly quirky and often laugh-out-loud hilarious, Mango Cheeks, Metal Teeth gently explores the themes of growing up, loss of innocence and the intimate yet aloof nature of upstairs-downstairs relationships.",6,0,/I9.jpg,/Mango_Cheeks_Metal_Teeth.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:37:30.386709",0

Since The Room on the Roof—his award-winning debut novel which introduced readers to the unforgettable Rusty, the orphan from Dehradun—Bond has created characters both charming and eccentric, which have endured in popular imagination. And, in what is perhaps his most towering achievement, Bond has brought to pulsing life the mountains, valleys and rivers of Garhwal, as well as the quiet magic of small, tucked-away places, in book after book.
The Writer on the Hill is a comprehensive selection of Bond’s fiction and non-fiction, both popular and little-known. In ‘Masterji’, a young man meets his old Hindi teacher on a train platform, in handcuffs. In the excerpt from The Room on the Roof, Rusty stands up to his bullying guardian. ‘Man and Leopard’ describes, in mesmerizing prose, a heart-breaking encounter between man and the wild. And, in ‘Once upon a Mountain Time’, Bond creates a charming portrait of his little patch of earth in Mussoorie.
A tribute to one of the most popular and loved writers of India, The Writer on the Hill is also a celebration of the quiet, unhurried life, lived at one’s own pace. This volume will delight Bond’s fans everywhere.",6,0,/I383.jpg,/The_Writer_on_the_Hill.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:37:32.538230",0

This volume titled “Timeless Tales of Mulla Nasrudin” contains 111 brief anecdotes like its predecessor, “Immortal Tales of Mulla Nasrudin” which also had 111 short episodes. The “Immortal Tales” is already available on KDP.
The third and last volume in the Mulla Nasrudin series by this author is not likely to be available on KDP before 2013 due to existing copyrights of a current print version in India. However the first two volumes, “The Immortal Tales” and “Timeless Tales” with no restrictions whatsoever are available to print publishers and others in United States and elsewhere and in any language and in any form separately, combined or abridged. Each anecdote included here is original and unpublished in English before.
Mulla Nasrudin needs no introduction. Believed to have lived in Turkey, Central Asia or China some time between 11th and 14th centuries, Nasrudin, with the Mulla and Hoja as titles denoting his scholarship or nobility, is undoubtedly the most humourous character in human history.
Known for his sarcasm and satire, wit and wisdom the Mulla stands taller than all his peers.
Needless to say that all the stories are timeless. Although the symbols, situations, geography, culture, economy, life style etc. are typically central Asian and medieval, their appeal is not limited to any particular age, clime or place.

You can help the needy and the downtrodden. I have written about the past richness of India and what happened in the past few centuries. When Christ was born India was the richest country in the world followed by China. Its riches were robbed when it became a colony in the 1800s. Then I explain what a mutual fund is. A mutual fund is a company that pools money from the investors and invest and manage the money for them. Why should one invest in Indian mutual funds? Indians are smart and hard working. It is democracy with full freedom. Indians are highly educated. Indian economy is growing at a pace of 6 to 7% annually. As the middle class is growing fast, the demand for goods domestically is high. So manufacturing and business will keep growing for decades to come. Indain mutual fund managers have shown their might in the past few decades. When I reviewed, I found 8 funds with an annual growth of over 30% over the last 5 year period. I found around 100 funds yielding an annual growth between 20% to 30% in the last 5 years. This is fantastic. I have given A SIMPLE YET VERY POWERFUL METHOD of investing in mutual funds in India. This is the method I have been using for many years with phenomenal results. I have explained the magic of compounding by giving a true story from India. The trick to become wealthy, is to start at a very early age. Because of the beauty of compounding, the results will be unbelievable. Let us say that you start investing at age 30, Rs1000 per month, and it grows at 25% a year, at 65 you will have Rs120,746,326. This is like magic. Even if it grows at 15% a year, you will have Rs10,707,217. This is a simple way to create a lot of wealth. You need to spend an hour every one year to adjust the portfolio and I have illustrated the way. There are no capital gains if you hold on to the investment for one year and one day. Let the mutual fund managers do all the brain work and make money for you. The final results will depend on the age you start investing at and for how long and the amount invested and the growth rate. The time is ripe for investing in Indian mutual funds and they should be growing at 6 to 7% a year for decades to come. If you choose the top performing funds, the growth rate of your funds can be 30% or even more",7,0,/I22.jpg,/Become_A_Crorepati.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:37:34.285510",0

If you browse through the interviews with some of the most successful people on Earth, you’ll find one common piece of advice shared by virtually all of them:

They never give up on their big goals.

Research shows that grit is a better predictor for success than any other factor. The ability to keep going despite setbacks is more important than your IQ, character or other external factors like your upbringing or surroundings.

But what does it really mean to “never give up”? What exactly is grit? How do you persevere when faced with larger than life difficulties? How do you keep going when you’re at the brink of exhaustion and all your hard work hasn’t been rewarded yet?

I wrote this book to explore the subject of persistence from a more scientific point of view than cliché self-help sayings. I want to share with you how exactly to stick to your goals according to peak performers and science – not vague motivational advice that assumes we have unlimited strength once we’re motivated enough.

Then, throughout the day, you complete other habits that positively impact your top goals. You’d probably feel more fulfilled, get more accomplished, and have a better direction for your career.

All of this is possible when you add DOZENS of small changes to your daily routine. These habits don’t require much effort. In fact, most of these habits ONLY take five minutes or less to complete. And all this can be done when you follow a strategy known as Habit Stacking.

One Routine + Multiple Habits = Habit Stacking

We all know its not easy to add multiple new habits to your day. But what you might not realize is its fairly easy to build a single new routine. The essence of habit stacking is to take a series of small changes and create a ritual that you follow on a daily basis. 

Habit stacking works because you eliminate the stress of trying to change too many things at once. Your goal is to simply focus on a single routine that only takes about 15 to 30 minutes to complete. Within this routine is a series of actions (or small changes). All you have to do is to create a checklist and follow it every single day.",7,0,/I407.jpg,/Habit_Stacking.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:37:35.715198",0

With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.

Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warrens Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nations largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.

At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.

Habits arent destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.",7,0,/I325.jpg,/The_Power_of_Habit.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:37:37.754343",0

The more their paths cross, the more he realizes that maybe letting her go was the biggest mistake of his life. 
Will Raashi forgive Sameer? Will Sameer fulfill his dream? Find out more in this book of love and second chances.

He has been called one of the century’s foremost explorers of the universe by the New York Times obituary. His ground breaking discoveries indicated to us that there is much more out there in our solar system than we knew about. 

Jan described dark matter to be the cause of the gravitational pull which pulls and keeps all the galaxies together. It was also thought that this gravity would slow the expansion of the universe as time went on. In 1998 however the Hubble Space Telescope made another discovery about the expansion of the universe. It had not been slowed down despite the presence of gravity. The expansion was occurring even faster than what it had been before. 

Some mysterious thing was responsible for this expansion. It was given the name of dark energy. Dark energy can be described to be the property of space. Einstein discovered that it is possible for more space to come into being. 

Planck which is a more sensitive satellite orbiting in the sky has made a thrilling new discovery lately. It was launched in 2009. It has managed to map the cosmic microwave background allowing scientists to look at remnants of light about 370,000 years after the occurrence of the big bang. Light has been thought to be trapped in some hot plasma which cooled. This caused the light to be set free from it. 

There are tiny imprints representing quantum fluctuations which occurred after the birth of the universe. It is this substance from which the all the matter which formed the stars and the galaxies came from. 

Planck is a more sensitive satellite with a higher resolution capability. Light patterns even one twelfth of a degree can be measured on the sky. 

The version of Einstein theory containing the cosmological constant states that empty space has its own energy. This energy will not be diluted even as the space expands. This property of space can cause the expansion of the universe to become faster. 

Space is also thought to get its energy from virtual particles which would appear and disappear. The calculation of energy however was not possible to calculate with enough accuracy.

In a sense, this was no surprise to the experts, since astronomers already had indirect evidence of the existence of gravitational radiation from studies of exotic stars known as binary pulsars. However, the direct detection was one of the greatest achievements of experimental physics, involving measuring displacements of space itself equivalent to a shift in the orbit of the planet Jupiter by the width of a human hair. This has opened up a new window on the universe for the investigation of exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars. John Gribbin tells the whole story of the search for gravitational waves, from Einsteins initial idea through the binary pulsar studies, the false starts and dead ends to the latest successful measurements and beyond, looking ahead to a space observatory being planned to study these waves in more detail. It is widely accepted that the Nobel Prize in physics for 2017 will be awarded for the discovery; here, you can get in on the ground floor and find out why it is worthy of that honour.

After working at North American Aviation and Northrop, he was hired by Douglas Aircraft Company in 1950, and when they found out about his involvement in classified work, was given a job as a to create design solutions as a draftsman with a peripheral assignment to work in a “think tank”. This work was partly controlled by the Navy personnel who used to work for James Forrestal, who was allegedly assassinated because he was going to publicly reveal what he knew about UFOs. Bill Tompkins was asked to conceive sketches of mile-long Naval interplanetary craft designs. 
Later, as he became involved in the conventional aspects of the Saturn Program that later became the Apollo launch vehicle, his insight to system engineering resulted in his offering some critical suggestions personally to Dr. Wernher von Braun about ensuring more reliable checkout using the missiles in their vertical position and also some very efficient launch control concepts adopted by both NASA and the Air Force.",9,0,/I532.jpg,/Selected_by_Extraterrestrials.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:37:51.197355",0

From dramatic, high-risk spacewalks to author Scott Parazynski’s death-defying quest to summit Mount Everest—his body ravaged by a career in space—readers will experience the life of an elite athlete, physician, and explorer.

This intimate, compelling account offers a rare portrait of space exploration from the inside. A global nomad raised in the shadow of NASA’s Apollo missions, Parazynski never lost sight of his childhood dream to one day don a spacesuit and float outside the airlock. With deep passion, unbridled creativity, resilience, humility, and self-deprecation, Parazynski chases his dream of the ultimate adventure experience, again and again and again. In an era that transitioned from moon shots to the Space Shuttle, space station, and Mars research, Parazynski flies with John Glenn, tests jet packs, trains in Russia to become a cosmonaut, and flies five missions to outer space (including seven spacewalks) in his seventeen-year NASA career.

An unparalleled, visceral opportunity to understand what it’s like to train for—and deploy to—a home in zero gravity, The Sky Below also portrays an astronaut’s engagement with the challenges of his life on Earth, including raising a beautiful autistic daughter and finding true love.",9,0,/I49.jpg,/The_Sky_Below.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:37:52.256300",0

On the one hand, such a view is the apotheosis of modern cosmology, on the other, it threatens to undermine almost everything we hold cosmologically sacrosanct. The map contains anomalies that challenge our understanding of the Universe. It will force us to revisit what is known and what is unknown, to construct a new model of our Universe.

The inherent challenge in getting even a simple two-transistor circuit to work is the conflict arising from having two such current source-like elements in series. The digital inverter is shown to be one such circuit that can function like an analog amplifier, albeit over a narrow range of input voltage. The effect of loading on such a circuit is illustrated graphically and is shown as an added challenge in getting it to work in an analog manner.

458,"Cats Cradle","Kurt Vonnegut",RosettaBooks,"Cat’s Cradle (1963) is Vonneguts most ambitious novel, which put into the language terms like wampeter, kerass and granfalloon as well as a structured religion, Boskonism and was submitted in partial fulfillment of requirements for a Masters Degree in anthropology, and in its sprawling compass and almost uncontrolled (and uncontrollable) invention, may be Vonneguts best novel. 

Written contemporaneously with the Cuban missile crisis and countenancing a version of a world in the grasp of magnified human stupidity, the novel is centered on Felix Hoenikker, a chemical scientist reminiscent of Robert Oppenheimer… except that Oppenheimer was destroyed by his conscience and Hoenikker, delighting in the disastrous chemicals he has invented, has no conscience at all. Hoenikkers Ice 9 has the potential to convert all liquid to inert ice and thus destroy human existence; he is exiled to a remote island where Boskonism has enlisted all of its inhabitants and where religion and technology collaborate, with the help of a large cast of characters, to destroy civilization.

Vonneguts compassion and despair are expressed here through his grotesque elaboration of character and situation and also through his created religion which like Flannery OConnors Church Without Christ (in Wise Blood) acts to serve its adherents by removing them from individual responsibility. Vonnegut had always been taken seriously by science fiction readers and critics (a reception which indeed made him uncomfortable) but it was with Cat’s Cradle that he began to be found and appreciated by a more general audience. His own ambivalence toward science, science fiction, religion and religious comfort comes through in every scene of this novel.

479,Slaughterhouse-Five,"Kurt Vonnegut",RosettaBooks,"Adapted for a magnificent George Roy Hill film three years later (perhaps the only film adaptation of a masterpiece which exceeds its source), Slaughterhouse-Five (1969) is the now famous parable of Billy Pilgrim, a World War II veteran and POW, who has in the later stage of his life become unstuck in time and who experiences at will (or unwillingly) all known events of his chronology out of order and sometimes simultaneously. 

Traumatized by the bombing of Dresden at the time he had been imprisoned, Pilgrim drifts through all events and history, sometimes deeply implicated, sometimes a witness. He is surrounded by Vonneguts usual large cast of continuing characters (notably here the hack science fiction writer Kilgore Trout and the alien Tralmafadorians who oversee his life and remind him constantly that there is no causation, no order, no motive to existence). 

The unstuck nature of Pilgrims experience may constitute an early novelistic use of what we now call Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; then again, Pilgrims aliens may be as real as Dresden is real to him. Struggling to find some purpose, order or meaning to his existence and humanitys, Pilgrim meets the beauteous and mysterious Montana Wildhack (certainly the authors best character name), has a child with her and drifts on some supernal plane, finally, in which Kilgore Trout, the Tralmafadorians, Montana Wildhack and the ruins of Dresden do not merge but rather disperse through all planes of existence. 

Slaughterhouse-Five was hugely successful, brought Vonnegut an enormous audience, was a finalist for the National Book Award and a bestseller and remains four decades later as timeless and shattering a war fiction as Catch-22, with which it stands as the two signal novels of their riotous and furious decade.

507,"A Biography of Rahul Dravid: The Nice Guy Who Finished First","Devendra Prabhudesai","Rupa Publications","Rahul Dravid, one of the greatest cricket players the game has seen in its entirety, lived by three Ds that got him to where he is: determination, dedication and discipline. The biography of Rahul Dravid written by Devendra Prabhudesai encompasses the life and times of the great player. It throws light on his trials and tribulations, wins and losses and other elements that shaped his glorious cricketing career. How he came to be an inspiration to so many young and aspiring cricketers who look up to him till date.

Rahul Dravid is known to be a humble person in his game as well his countenance, never letting the public critique or the fame get to his head. The innings he played in his entire career has been magnificent and Prabhudesai does complete justice to his journey. He was the first Indian to score five double centuries in test cricket and four centuries in a consecutive four test innings. His career might have been overshadowed by the success of Sachin Tendulkar but it was not enough to bring his spirits down and he continued to play his best.

Being the first batsman to have scored a century against every country that played test matches, Dravid outdid himself continuously in his career. As a tribute to one of the greatest batsman the nation has witnessed, Rahul Dravid is the story of a man who never once lost his composure because of competition and gave the Indian cricket team their best years.",11,0,/I235.jpg,/A_Biography_of_Rahul_Dravid.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:38:00.579226",0

What we can dispute, however, is the fact that to get that nice toned body you need to spend thousands of hours in the gym ‘hitting’ weights as if your life depended on it. 

We live in a world where to make ends meet, the conventional person has to work a 9-5 job–sometimes even multiple jobs—not to mention the many hours we spend in transit or stuck in traffic jams—the average person loses 42 hours a year to traffic jams. As such, making time for the gym may not be feasible. Does this mean that just because you cannot make your way to the gym, you should let the fat accumulate and the muscles waste away? Definitely NO! 

While strength training is an ideal way to sculpt your body and you should schedule some consistent gym time into your schedule, if you cannot make it to the gym, there are exercises you can practice to enjoy the benefits of strength training without having to go to the gym. Calisthenics is one such type of exercise.

But what are calisthenics and how can you get started on the practice? That is the purpose of this guide: to show you how to use calisthenics to sculpt a beach-worthy body that you are proud of.",11,0,/I294.jpg,/CALISTHENICS.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:38:01.039448",0

522,"Innings of a Lifetime","Ralph Barker","Endeavour Press","In the course of a game, nothing is more thrilling than an innings in which a batsman rises above his fellows and his own shortcomings to play a decisive part in achieving victory — or it may be in avoiding defeat, or in salvaging national pride.

The burly Peter Burge turning defeat into victory for Australia at Leeds in 1964, the young Colin Cowdrey saving England at Melbourne in his first Test series, the unorthodox Bob Barber setting such a frenetic tempo at Sydney that England had time to bowl Australia out twice, the two centuries by Glenn Turner that gave New Zealand their first win over Australia — these are among the examples of the first of these extremes. 

No fight back from apparently certain defeat could be more memorable than the way Gary Sobers and his younger cousin David Holford saved the West Indies at Lord’s in 1966 — and very nearly turned the tables on England. 

And avoiding national humiliation was the achievement of Asif Iqbal at the Oval in 1967 and Derek Randall at Melbourne in the 1977 Centenary Test.

Ten of these momentous innings are reconstructed here, in the context of the match in which they were played, the series, and the careers of the individual players, and they have provided a rich vein for research and analysis. 

But more than that, the greater riches, as the author demonstrates, often lie beneath the surface, to be mined only by talks with the players, and in innings after innings he has truly struck oil.

Readers will do more than re-live these innings as if from the terraces. They will walk to the crease with the batsman, and share the unforgettable experience that each innings contains.",11,0,/I269.jpg,/INNINGS_OF_A_LIFETIME.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:38:02.265438",0

538,"Soccer Drills: A 100 Soccer Drills to Improve Your Skills, Strategies and Secrets","Chest Dugger","Chest Dugger","Whether known as football or, as in the US, soccer; the ‘beautiful game’ is the most popular sport in the world. The best players earn millions of dollars per year, and the greatest clubs are icons in their regions. Children love putting down a couple of jerseys and having a kick around. It is, globally, the team sport that has the greatest public participation and, at the highest level such as the World Cup, top leagues and cup finals, matches are watched live by tens of thousands of cheering fans. Support is only limited by stadium size, with tens or even hundreds of millions following their team on TV.

It is therefore no surprise that so many people love to play the game, and want to become better at it. Youngsters dream of becoming the next Pele, Messi, Maradona or Ronaldo. This book offers coaches and players an insight into how to become a better soccer player. There are chapters on the role of the individual in this team game, and the role of the team in a sport lit up by the brilliance of individuals. 
There are drills listed to help the player and his side. Indeed, it is drills that lead to players becoming experts, as good as they can be. Drills take the individual components of soccer and allow practice in a pressure free, or pressure controlled, environment.

Imagine that a game of soccer is like an English Literature examination. For that test, you get taught the information you need to know; you practice using that learning in tests, discussions and essays. You work on it on your own, making sure that your mind is fit enough to tackle the challenge of the final exam.

What you very much do not want is to be learning new concepts under the pressure of the examination hall. That is the place to show what you can do, not try out risky ideas.

In many ways, sport is the same. For soccer, the examination is the match; learning the skills is like gaining your understanding of Shakespeare; applying those skills is automatic in the chaos of the game. Those exercises you worked on in training ensure that you are fit enough to survive the game at your best.

And just like a piece of great literature, so a great soccer performance is made up of separate elements, which combine to produce the art form that is the ‘beautiful game.’ Just as you could examine character, plot, language and metaphor when studying ‘Macbeth’, a great performance in soccer is made up of control, passing, shooting, defending and teamwork.

Those elements can be broken down, practiced and perfected during drills. The drill allows for experimentation; failure and error does not matter. Indeed, we learn through our mistakes. There is less pressure during a drill, so time can be spent getting the individual skills and movements right. A good coach can help a player focus on areas of weakness. Pressure can be introduced slowly, and in a controlled way, ratcheted up to recreate conditions more like those in the match situation.

During practice sessions, often younger (and probably older!) players long for the ‘game.’ ‘Can we play a match now?’ is the sort of request coaches of younger players will recognize readily. And that is fine, a little match – perhaps one that reinforces the skills on which the session focuses on, makes a fun and useful end to a coaching session. But drills are crucial in helping players to become the best they can be.

These skill sessions can be focused on the individual, working on technique perhaps in groups of two to four; they can also be larger group drills, or whole team activities which help mutual understanding and coordination.",11,0,/I483.jpg,/Soccer_Drills.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:38:04.363784",0

Many competitive athletes suffer from what is known as ‘overuse syndrome’. Sportspersons who perform repetitive movements often end up with tight, overused muscles that become vulnerable to pulls and sprains, and underused muscles that progressively get weaker. It is this classic syndrome that countless athletes experience at various points in their careers.
In a life spanning over eight decades, Yogacharya BKS Iyengar has taught several sportspersons, right from Professor DB Deodhar, the grand old man of Indian cricket, to the willow-and-wicket genius, Sachin Tendulkar, the finer points of yoga. 
Yoga For Sports shows how yoga can train the mind and body and help sportspeople become more agile, stronger and focused. Yoga is based on the principle of integrating the body as a whole and shifts the emphasis to the quality of the movement. With precise discussion on the human anatomy and detailed techniques for performing over 100 asanas and pranayama; with asana modifications, props and specific sequences for varying body and mind conditions, this book views a sportsperson’s well-being from a holistic point of view.

575,"Goa Travel: Being the Accounts of Travellers from the 16th to the 21st Century","Manohar Shetty","Rupa Publications","Centuries before Goa became the epicentre of the counterculture of the hippie and flower power generation in the sixties and seventies, it was known as the Eldorado, the City of Gold, the prized possession of the Portuguese empire in the East. From the early 16th century onwards, its magnetic appeal drew scores of travellers and adventurers to its gleaming shores. Driven by ambition, wanderlust, proselytism, and its fabled wealth and beauty, these travellers came from across Europe from Holland, England, Germany, France, Italy and other nations. Many of them left behind vivid and riveting accounts of their journeys and sojourn in the Rome of the East . This anthology encapsulates the best of these writings spread over 450 years of Portuguese rule as well as accounts by the contemporary traveller. 

Goa Travels is an essential guide and companion for the curious visitor as well as resident Goans who have forgotten the land s rich, eventful and colourful heritage. It goes far beyond the glossy tourist brochure and will enable both historian and holidaymaker to turn back the pages and dwell on Goa s extraordinary past. The writings also reflect its fading lustre in the 18th and 19th century and its resurrection in contemporary times. ",12,0,/I221.jpg,/Goa_Travel.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:38:09.136375",0

It is the seat of the first Malay sultanate which dominated the important international trade route along Straits of Malacca.

It then fell to other colonial powers - first the Dutch in the 17th century, followed by the British in the 19th century, and finally the Japanese during the Second World War.

Today, Malacca is a lively and colourful city with its colonial charm well-preserved. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008.

599,"The Talent Sutra: An Indian Approach to Learning","Devdutt Pattanaik","Rupa Publications","Saraswati is the goddess of knowledge in Hinduism, as well as in Buddhism and Jainism. Her name is derived from the fluidity (saras) of the imagination. Human imagination enables us to invent and innovate, visualize, plan and de-risk. Yet imagination is a bad word in the world of business and management. It strips us of certainty. We want to control the imagination of those who work for us, prevent their minds from wandering from work. Yet every human being lives in an imagined reality. Recognizing this enables us to work with talent, build strong relationships and nurture people to face any situation with faith and patience. Failure to recognize imagination is why family-owned businesses are unable to manage professionals and how professionally- run companies end up creating ineffective, mechanistic talent management systems. Training, learning and development, are not just about skills and knowledge and competencies, they are about appreciating the human-animal, recognizing that neither we nor those around us are programmable machines that we can plug and play. Managing people, hence relationships, is key to the survival of an organization. 
Derived from Devdutt Pattanaik’s influential bestseller Business Sutra, this book explores concepts like creativity in the workplace, nurturing talent and the importance of teamwork. It will help employers and managers become more inclusive leaders who are able to carry their team along with them.",12,0,/I33.jpg,/The_Talent_Sutra.pdf,NULL,NULL,"2018-03-09 22:38:11.757738",0
